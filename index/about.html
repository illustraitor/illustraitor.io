                <p>
                My name is Kim Calderwood (they/she) and I graduated CSULB with a degree in Illustration (Pre-production). I enjoy video games, hiking, reading and cheap instant coffee. I have been drawing for most of my adult life, and I tend to gravitate towards drawing figures, but I do love the occasional environment piece. Most of my work is digital, mainly because it’s quicker and easier to experiment with; I do keep an analog sketchbook, though. I have played with just about every drawing software I could get my hands on, as well as a good chunk of animating ones. I consider myself to be decently tech literate when it comes to art software, and I intend to keep learning. (With the exception of AI ones, I wouldn’t enjoy having something take over most of the process for me. The process is where the magic is, baby.)
