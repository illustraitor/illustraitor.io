        <h2>Linking out?</h2>
        <p>I read <a href="https://thoughts.melonking.net/thoughts/every-site-needs-a-links-page-why-linking-matters">this article</a> by Melon King that talked about the importance of linking outside your website, and I was convinced! Plus, I found most of the useful information in my art journey from other folks on the internet. I think it's a good idea to pass on knowledge and resources where you can. Below are links to various artists and resources that I have come across in my time browsing the internet that I will update periodically (there's so much more I want to share, compiling is just time-consuming!).</p>
        <p>I hope you find something new and interesting!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>General Artists:</h2>
        <p>Some you may already have heard of! These are a collection of artists who's work I've stumbled across over the years that caught my eye.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.celine-kim.com/home1">Celine Kim</a></strong>: A visual development artist with a stunning collection of work. I really dig the Phantom of the Opera vis dev she made.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.chuwenjie.com/">Kat Tsai:</a></strong> Their illustrations feel like fleeting memories, her control over color is impeccable!</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.celialowenthal.com/about">Celia Lowenthal</a>:</strong> I've been a fan of her work for a while, she has a bold pallet and heavy inks which is always a weakness for me.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://kayleerowena.com/">Kaylee Rowena:</a></strong> Not only are their illustrations eerie and whimsical, I was inspired by them to make this website!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Special Treatment:</h2>
        <p>This is the section for some of my friends and acquaintances!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://amyloanguyen.com/">Amy Nguyen</a>:</strong> Amy is a vis dev and storyboard artist with a whimsical and energetic style. Annnd she's one of the funniest people I know!</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://jmd6633.wixsite.com/janetdoanart">Janet Doan</a>:</strong> Janet's style is so cute, and she does a whole lot of different illustration-related mediums. She primarily works with watercolor (neat!) but can do anything.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.annadinhart.com/">Anna Dinh</a>:</strong> Is also a vis dev artist and storyboarder! She's is talented in so many creative mediums and smart as hell.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://genesislugo34.wixsite.com/mysite">Genisis Lugo</a></strong>: They make killer storyboards and have a tendency of falling into small and niche fandoms and being their bread and butter for fanart, which I think metal.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/putrosposts/about-me">Sarah Putros</a>:</strong> A teacher I had back in college who was (and still is) a fountain of knowledge, her students are lucky to have her.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.jennibambani.com/">Jenni</a>:</strong>&nbsp; A joy to be around, they are full of love for their community and the earth. Jenni's painting's at times feel like they are breathing, others feel like a memory. Hard to explain, but I love it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Illustration Resources:</h2>
        <p>My go-to sites</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://croquis.cafe/">Crouqis-Cafe:</a></strong>&nbsp; A paid alternative to <a href="https://line-of-action.com/practice-tools/figure-drawing">Line of Action</a> for figure drawing reference. Line of action is great, I just like Crouqis' selection a little more.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://williamnguyen.artstation.com/projects/GX3Ax1">William Nguyen's Head Models:</a> </strong>Free head reference</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/arm-bones#1">Healthline Anatomical models: </a></strong>This is for medical students but it's so cool! You can peel back layers of the body and see where the muscles and bones connect with one another.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Website Building:</h2>
        <p>This list is copied from my <a href="/index/website.html">About This Website</a> page</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://discourse.32bit.cafe/t/resources-list-for-the-personal-web/49" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>32-Bit Cafe | Resource List:</strong></a> A huge list of website making resources, a bit overwhelming to look through but just pick what sounds useful to you.</li>
        <li><a href="https://32bit.cafe/cyowebsite/#0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>32-Bit Cafe | Creating Your Own Website:</strong></a> Good getting started info.</li>
        <li><a href="https://anemptyblissbeyondthisworld.neocities.org/index-inner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Organization Recommendation:</strong></a> I got this from the 32-Bit Cafe master list, but it would have saved me pain if I had read it early on in my process.</li>
        <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>A Complete Guide to Flexbox:</strong></a> My layout heavily uses the flex box element, this is a good summary of its components.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3 Schools:</strong></a> This site has general info on pretty much anything code related. It's one of those sites that's so popular I thought it wasn't worth mentioning, but here it is just in case.</li>
        <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Stackoverflow:</strong></a> This was my oracle. I never posted any questions myself (I'm shy~) but it almost always had answers.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.responsinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Responsinator:</strong></a> Check what your website looks like on other devices!</li>
        <li><a href="https://onlinehtmleditor.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HTML Editor:</strong></a> I use this to type out my text before putting in my html doc. My browser has a spellcheck and the editor formats everything for you. Handy!</li>
        <li><a href="https://rarebit.neocities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rarebit Webcomic Layout:</strong></a> Handy if you have a comic you wan to display</li>
        <li><a href="https://smolcss.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>smolcss:</strong></a> I wish I had found this sooner! It's CSS codes for responsive elements.</li>
