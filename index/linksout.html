                    <p>I read <a href="https://thoughts.melonking.net/thoughts/every-site-needs-a-links-page-why-linking-matters">this article</a> by Melon King that talked about the importance of linking outside your website, and I was convinced! Plus, I found most of the useful information in my art journey from other folks on the internet. I think it's a good idea to pass on knowledge and resources where you can. Below are links to various artists and resources that I have come across in my time browsing the internet that I will update periodically (there's so much more I want to share, compiling is just time-consuming!).</p>
    
                    <p>I hope you find something new and interesting!</p>
