                    <h2>Why did I do this?</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>While very clean and seamless most modern website layouts look, I had a really hard time finding one that fit my aesthetic. I had also been falling into neocities rabbit holes and looking through a variety of websites with fun layouts. Some of my favorites are here. That being said, the site we are currently on is pretty basic and probably doesn't stray too far from your typical squarespace portfolio. But, having a responsive portfolio makes sense since you'll be showing recruiters or showing folks your website on your phone. It's just business, I just added flair where I could without sacrificing too much responsivesness<sup>1</sup>. I hope to add even more flair to it as time goes on. While nowhere near as cool, I took a lot of inspo from Kaylee Rowena's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kayleerowena.com/">website</a>. If you look at their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kayleerowena.com/illustration/">illustration gallery</a>, you'll see the elements perfectly collapse on top of one another when re-sizing. Also, they have such a stellar collection of artwork.</p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10px;">1. Responsiveness is the ability for a website to adapt to various screen sizes and browsers. &nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Want to make your own website?</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Here are a list of resources I found the most helpful, in no particular order. Gotta be honest though, most of what I did was peek under the hood of other folks' websites (right click + inspect ) and then try things I liked for myself; and then praying someone on stackoverflow had already asked about a hyper-specific problem I was having. If I could start over though, I would peek through these resources before even starting. A lot of the issues I was having would have been solved if I had justâ€¦read ahead. I like to do trial by fire, but this was a lot of fire. Hell, even. Also, I recomend making a mock-up in an image editor before getting started, for reference and motivation.&nbsp;</p>
