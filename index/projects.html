        <h3>Animatic/Storyboards</h3>
            <br>
        
            <p>
            This is a project I worked on in 2022 for EMA Films. I storyboarded and made a quick animatic out of a scene from the script they gave me. This project is still in development, so recruiters can email me at kim.a.calderwood@gmail.com for animatic link.

            <p>
                A short comic I did during my last year in school. While it had some technical issues that didn't pan out the way I had hoped, I'm still proud of the work I put into it. You can click the title to go read it.

        <h3>Animation</h3>
            <br>
          
            <p>
            In 2021 I had a class that had us do a group animation. I did a lot of backgrounds for it, as well as the compositing and editing. It definitely looks like a student film, but I still think it's cute. You can click the title to check it out.
